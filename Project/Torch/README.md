## Some info

Here are presented main pyTorch models, that were used in this project and also train file and data loader file.

Before run you have to choose one of the dataset:
- dataset = 'mnist'
- dataset = 'mnist_fashion'

And one of the model:
- Model = 'simple' for SimpleNet;
- Model = 'large' for LargeNet;
- Model = 'relu' for ReLUNet;
- Model = 'lenet' for Lenet.

Also the .ipunb file is appended to run the whole train.
